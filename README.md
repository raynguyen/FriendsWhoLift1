# Kinect
Android App that allows user's to join 'Groups' or 'Events' with the intention of planning social activities and to connect with people who have the same hobbies.

## Concept and Inspiration
This is a hobby project that I have been using to learn Android development. The inspiration came from my love of spending time with friends and family and organized sports.

## About Me
I am an engineer looking to switch into software development. I have a degree in physics and engineering but have experienced and worked on project specific software and I have committed to becoming a software developer.

## Completed
1. Model classes for Groups, Events, and Users.
2. Firebase/store CRUD queries for events.
3. Firebase/store CRUD queries for groups.
4. Firebase/store CRUD queries for user profiles.
5. User account creation via email with Firebase.
6. Created the 'Main' and 'Login' activities.
7. Implemented a Launch screen with animations to the Login and Main activities.

## ToDo
1. General design is uncomplete.
2. SharedContentTransitions fom a RecyclerView within a ViewPager does not work as intended.
3. Send messages to the phone when their user account receives a message within the Application.
4. There's still alot.
